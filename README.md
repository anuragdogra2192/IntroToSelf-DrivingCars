# Intro To Self-Driving Cars
https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113


In this program, you’ll sharpen your Python skills, apply C++, apply matrices and calculus in code, and touch on computer vision and machine learning. 
These concepts will be applied to solving self-driving car problems. At the end, you’ll be ready for our Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program!

## Contents:

### Bayesian Thinking
Learn the framework that underlies a self-driving car’s understanding of itself and the world around it, and to see the world the way a self-driving car does.

### Working with Matrices
This course will focus on two tools which are vital to self-driving car engineers: object oriented programming and linear algebra.

### C++ Basics
This course is the first step in a rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. The goal is translation: get a program written in Python, and translate it into C++.

### Performance Programming in C++
Explore how to write good code that runs correctly. We’ll focus primarily on low level features of C++, but we’ll discuss other best practices as well.

### Navigating Complex Data Structures
Algorithmic thinking is a skill you’ll refine throughout your career. In this course you’ll focus on frequently used data structures and algorithms.

### Visualizing Calculus and Controls
In this course you’ll learn basic calculus—the mathematics of continuity. You’ll also learn to use some of Python’s most popular visualization libraries.

### Machine Learning and Computer Vision
In this course you’ll learn how a computer sees an image, and how we can use machine learning to teach a computer to identify images programmatically.
